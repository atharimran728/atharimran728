# 👋 Hey there, I'm Maverick (Athar Imran)

### 🧠 About Me  
I’m a cybersecurity student and SOC Analyst-in-training passionate about **threat detection**, **incident response**, and **adversary emulation**.  
My journey began with a simple question — *“How does this work?”* — and evolved into a mission to understand how attackers think so I can stop them.

I believe in building from the ground up:  
`Networking → Logs → Linux → Adversary Emulation → Defense`
